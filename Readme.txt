*  Description of the program
*******************************************************

The program will load a given dictionary used to spell
check a user-specified file. The code is implemented
using a custom hash, though there were no classes
created to do this (I didn't see a requirement to,
and the program is small enough). There is a commented-
out feature which counts the frequency of encountered
words. There are two dictionaries-one to satisfy the
requirement, and another for a larger dictionary.
